# HW_1-Code_Refactor

## Description
My goal in this project was to make this website accessible and more browser friendly. Accessibility is important so people with disabilities are still able to view sites and get the same information as people without disabilities. Having accessible websites can also help companies be more credible and relatable. 

I built this project because I like organizing ideas and making the flow within a code make sense. Refactoring the html for this code into something more logical will not only help the browser when reading the site, but will also help future coders viewing the code be able to understand the logic and flow. This will help with efficiency in future projects or refactors. 

Doing this refactor helped me to see the importance on semantic html and how to use semantic tags appropriately. It also helped me sythesize the material I've learned thus far on html to understand how to set up a website that makes logical sense. 
## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
