# HW_1-Code_Refactor

## Description
My goal in this project was to make this website accessible and more browser friendly. Accessibility is important so people with disabilities are still able to view sites and get the same information as people without disabilities. Having accessible websites can also help companies be more credible and relatable. 

I built this project because I like organizing ideas and making the flow within a code make sense. Refactoring the html for this code into something more logical will not only help the browser when reading the site, but will also help future coders viewing the code be able to understand the logic and flow. This will help with efficiency in future projects or refactors. 

I started by going through the HTML and seeing which semantic elements made sense for each div. I first made a header element with a nav element nested within. This set apart the top header and navigation bar. The next portion is an image that makes up about half of the page. This, I labeled a figure. Next, I separated the body into two portions. Within the first section, I labeled the three separate divs into articles. As the website will show, there are three separate sections, each displaying different pieces of information. Those are now articles. I labeled the second portion of the site an aside, since it's separated out from the main body of the page. Each bit of information within that aside is labeled as a figure. Lastly, I labeled the bottom portion as the footer. This holds the copyright. 

Doing this refactor helped me to see the importance on semantic html and how to use semantic tags appropriately. It also helped me sythesize the material I've learned thus far on html to understand how to set up a website that makes logical sense.
